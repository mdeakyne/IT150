You should limit yourself to 1 hour if you are not taking this course in class.
All notes are allowed, but YOU MAY NOT use Pycharm, or run the code.
Save the file with your last name replacing the blank.

This is a text file, specifically because you are not to open it in Pycharm. 
Today you are taking a practice quiz that should better prepare you for the eventual tests. 
You may not use Pycharm to run any of the example code, and you may not test out your code in Pycharm.  
You should be able to read and evaluate my code and your own code without relying on a program to run it.
This quiz is still worth 25 points, and will be counted as your 5th lab.

1. 
tiger = True
lion = False
cheetah = lion and tiger
bear = lion or not cheetah
panther = tiger and not lion and bear
bobcat = not panther or cheetah or lion
wolf = lion or not (panther and bear)

Write out below what boolean value is stored in each of these variables:
tiger is true
lion is false
cheetah is false
bear is true
panther is true
bobcat is false
wolf is false



2.
def long_enough(password):
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    else:
        return True

def begins_vowel(password):
    if password[0] in ['a','e','i','o','u']:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def ends_number(password):
    if password[-1].isdigit():
        return True
    else:
        return False

def middle_lower(password):
	middle = len(password)/2
	if password[middle].islower():
		return True
	else:
		return False
		
Write a function that takes in password as an argument, and returns true if all above functions are true.
Name this function     pass_check
def pass_check(password)
	if long_enough=True and begins_vowel=True and ends_number=True and middle_lower=True:
		return True






3. 
Tell me what these will print:

a. print pass_check("angle1") = False
b. print pass_check("yesterday5") = False
c. print pass_check("ambiguous9") = True
d. print pass_check("answErs10") = False
e. print pass_check("amazingthree") = False
f. print pass_check("erroneous7") = True






4.
Write code below that will tell you the difference in days between today and July 17th.
This is how many days Deakyne has to wait until he meets his daughter. DO NOT MAKE A FUNCTION.
Print it in the following fashion:
"Deakyne has to wait X days to meet his daughter"       replace x with the actual number of days.

import datetime
now = datetime.now
future = datetime = (2015,07,17)
time = future - now
many_days=time.days
print "Deakyne has to wait %s days to meet his daughter" % (many_days) 



5.
Write a function that takes in two arguments : a, b
Have it print out the following two things:
"a divided by b is X with remainder Y"   (replace x and y and z with the actual results)
"in decimal this is Z"
you may name the function whatever you like, but it must PRINT and not RETURN.

def this_function(a,b):
	x=a/b
	y=a%b
	z=float(x)
	print "%s divided by %s is %s with remainder %s. In decimal this is %s" % (a,b,x,y,z)
