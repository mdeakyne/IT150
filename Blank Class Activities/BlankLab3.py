"""
Write out code that takes one input from the user: An 8 digit number.
Since we don't know how to error check, your program will have errors if someone enters a number less than 8 digits.

Do the following with this number:
store the number's 1 and 2nd numbers into a variable.
store the number's 3 and 4th numbers into a variable.
store the number's 5,6,7 and 8th numbers into a variable.

Convert all the variables from strings to ints. To turn things into type <str> we use srt(var),
how do you think we turn things into type <int>?

print out three statements in the following format:
Replace your var name with the literal name, and the two variables with string formatting.
"Variable (your var name) contains <variable>, which is of type <variable type>"
"""
#1 : Take in a number from the user
#2 : Use indexing and <str> + <str> to add together parts of the input into variables.
#3 : Make each variable into an <int>
#4 : Print out the sentence, using string formatting, and the type() function.

Look up the day the university starts the semester, and the last day of finals. Figure out how many days are in between.

print out a string of the following format:
"In Spring of 2015, there are <variable> days in our semester"

#Problem 3: 11 points
"""
Combine the skills you used for the two problems above, and write code that asks the user for two days in the following
format:MMDDYYYY.  You should have two prompts - the start day and the end day.  Use these inputs to make two
datetime objects, and calculate the difference in days.
