"""
Today you are writing two functions:

1. Write a function that does the following:
    -The function has three arguments : a dictionary, a key and a value
    -If the key is in the dictionary, set that key equal to the current value plus the value argument.
    -If the key is not in the dictionary, set the key equal to the value
    -print every key and value in the dictionary


2. Write a function that does the following:
    -The function has no arguments
    -Make an empty dictionary
    -Take in a string from the user using raw_input()
    -Make the string lower case
    -Go through each letter in the string
    -If the letter is not in the dictionary, then set the value equal to 1.
    -If the letter is in the dictionary, add 1 to the value currently stored for that key.
    -After building the dictionary
    -Print every key and value in the dictionary.


You are responsible for testing these functions.  Make sure they work as you expect before submitting your assingment to espire.
